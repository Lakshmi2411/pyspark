## Big Data Analytics Project
This project involves analysis of a network intrusion detection dataset using Big Data tools and techniques.

## Contents
The PDF report contains the following sections:

Initiate and Configure Spark
Set up Spark environment
Load dataset into Spark DataFrame
## Task 1: Spark SQL
Execute SQL queries on data for analysis
## Task 2 - Part 1: PySpark
Perform analytics and feature analysis using PySpark
## Task 2 - Part 2: PySpark
Build machine learning models with PySpark
Convert Notebook to HTML
## Dataset
The project uses the CICIDS2018 dataset containing network intrusion data.

## Tools
The following Big Data tools are used:

Apache Spark - Cluster computing framework

PySpark - Python API for Spark

Spark SQL - SQL queries with Spark DataFrames

Spark ML - Machine learning library

## Models
Machine learning models implemented:

Random forest classifier

Bisecting K-Means Clustering

Linear regression

Decision tree regressor

## Usage
The Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis conducted in the project. The report can be read to understand the approach and outcomes in detail.

The project demonstrates Big Data analytics skills on a practical network intrusion dataset using PySpark and other Big Data tools. The code and discussion provide a template for working on similar data analytics tasks.
